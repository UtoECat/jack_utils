# jackutils - what is this?
Jackutils is a library and a set of useful utilities for the jack audio server. The library implements a simple api for managing connected ports using descriptors, connecting and checking whether the jack server is working, opening a glfw window and primitive drawing functions (for visualizations, optional)
# list of utilites (TODO list lmao)

- **Waveform** *(visualization utility)*
- **Spectrum** *(visualization utility)* **TODO**

# real TODO and contributing
- C is cool and impressive, but also not easy. Rewriting some internal things in C++ would be very nice... Or maybe even allow the application to immediately use the C++ API, without proofing in the form of C
- I need more tests in real problems, not for my toy needs. If you have any ideas and suggestions, write to Suggestions
- Check is this readme is lexically correct. I hate google translator :D
